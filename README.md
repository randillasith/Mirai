# Mirai – Smart Parking Management System

Mirai is an IoT-based smart parking management system developed as a **mini-project** for the **1st Year, 1st Semester** module **Fundamentals of Computing**, under the **Information Technology degree pathway** at **Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT)**.

The project focuses on monitoring parking slot availability in real time using sensors, microcontrollers, and a backend server. Mirai helps drivers quickly identify available parking spaces while assisting administrators in efficiently managing parking resources.

## Project Objectives
- Detect vehicle presence in parking slots using sensors  
- Send real-time parking data to a backend server  
- Display parking availability through a web dashboard  
- Reduce time spent searching for parking spaces  
- Demonstrate practical use of IoT and embedded systems

## System Overview
1. Sensors detect whether a parking slot is occupied or free  
2. A microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino) processes the sensor data  
3. Data is sent to the backend via HTTP 
4. The backend stores and processes the data  
5. The web dashboard displays real-time parking status
